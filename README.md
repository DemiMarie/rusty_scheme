# rusty_scheme: a "simple" Scheme interpreter, written in Rust.

This is a simple Scheme interpreter, written in Rust.  It is intended for extending applications written in Rust, or as an interpreter for general use.

It is woefully incomplete yet, to the point that it does not even compile, much less run hello world.  Contributions would be greatly appreciated.
