# rusty_scheme: a "simple" Scheme interpreter, written in Rust.

This is a simple Scheme interpreter, written in Rust.  It is intended for extending applications written in Rust, or as an interpreter for general use.

It is woefully incomplete yet, to the point that it does not even compile, much less run hello world.  Contributions would be greatly appreciated.

I would love any contributions to be project, and will review any PRs and in all likelyhood will accept them.  I will probably not be able to work much on this project on my own for a while, since college is starting up again. (But I do plan to finish it.)
